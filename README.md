# LiveEnhancementSuite-Live12
Live Enhancement Suite (LES) v1.3.5 updated for Live 12 with 3 new added keybinds forked from jastro. Now compatible with Live 12.3 via improved right-click menu search routine that works again. Also, browser-closing now realised via Ctrl + Alt + B shortcut instead of mouse click (which tends to fail). Buplicate has a new shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + B) to allow for Bouncing to new track via Ctrl + B.

This is just a bare update to make LES work great again *cough* on Live 12.3 mainly for myself, I'm not a proper AHK developer.

# LiveEnhancementSuite-Live12
**Live Enhancement Suite (LES) v1.3.5** updated for Live 12 with 3 new added keybinds (forked from jastro). 
Improvements: 
* Now compatible with Live 12.3 via **improved right-click menu search routine** that works again with better timings.
* Optional **closing of the browser** after a search is now realised via the _Ctrl + Alt + B_ shortcut instead of previously via mouse click with coordinates (which tended to fail). Settings for this (resetbrowsertobookmark) are still respected, coordinates aren't.
* **Buplicate** has a new shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + B) to allow for Bouncing to new track via Ctrl + B.

This is just a bare update to make LES work great again *cough* on Live 12.3, mainly for my own use, but hopefully beneficial for others as well. I'm not a proper AHK developer.
